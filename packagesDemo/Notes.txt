Packages are used to group similar classes, interfaces and enums together.

*uses of packages:-
1)Naming convinience - We can make classes with the same name in different packages.
					   Hence We are able to use the same same again and agian.

2)Package provide protection to the clsses and interfaces because the access specifier work on the
  basis of packages.
  Example: default methods or variables will not be visible from any class present outside the package.

3)Code reusability - If we want to use the code of a class from some other package we have to option of
                     importing that class in our program.
                     
Sub Packages: These are packages made inside another package.
